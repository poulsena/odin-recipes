                <li>Hazy IPA beer</li>
                <li>White sugar</li>
                <li>Dried oregano</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>
                <li>Diced fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
                <li>Extra chunky salsa</li>
                <li>Pinto beans, drained</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add beef to a dry cold pot, and turn heat to high</li>
                <li>
                    When beef begins to sizzle, break up into small pieces with
                    a potato masher or spatula. Meat can be broken up into very
                    fine crumbles, or into larger chunks, depending on the
                    desired texture. Continue to cook and break up beef until no
                    longer pink, about 7 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add chili powder, chipotle, black pepper, salt, and cinnamon
                    to the pot. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then pour in beer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pot
                    as you do. Let mixture boil until liquid is reduced by about
                    half, 2 to 3 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add sugar, oregano, garlic powder, diced tomatoes and jarred
                    salsa. Stir in; return mixture to a simmer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in beans, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring
                    occasionally, until chili is thickened and flavor is
                    developed to your liking, about 1 hour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Taste, adjust the seasoning. Top with sour cream, green
                    onions, Cheddar cheese, and cilantro as desired.
