        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A moist, light peach cake is topped with a sugary sweet,
            praline-like icing for a decadent dessert. Since this recipe starts
            with boxed cake mix and canned peaches, you can make it easily any
            time of year, not just when peaches are in season! Replace the icing
            with a crumble topping for a more coffee cake-like variation.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a
                13x9-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain juice from the cans of peaches into a measuring cup until
                you have 1/2 cup of peach juice. Set aside the 1/2 cup of peach
                juice and discard remaining juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chop peaches and pat with paper towels to remove some of the
                excess moisture. Add chopped peaches to a small mixing bowl and
                toss with 1 tablespoon of the cake mix.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, beat remaining cake mix, eggs, oil, and
                1/2 cup reserved peach juice with an electric mixer until well
                combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle chopped
                peaches evenly over batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the
                center comes out clean (a few moist crumbs are okay), 28 to 33
                minutes. Allow cake to begin cooling on a wire rack while you
                prepare icing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place brown sugar, butter, and cream in a saucepan and bring to
                a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is
                dissolved, 10 to 15 minutes from the time you first turned on
                the heat. Stir in vanilla until well mixed, then remove from
                heat.
            </li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in confectioners' sugar until smooth.</li>
            <li>
                Immediately pour icing over warm cake, and spread quickly with a
                spatula into an even layer, as icing will set quickly.
            </li>
        </ol>
