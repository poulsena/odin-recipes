            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A moist, light peach cake is topped with a sugary sweet,
                praline-like icing for a decadent dessert. Since this recipe
                starts with boxed cake mix and canned peaches, you can make it
                easily any time of year, not just when peaches are in season!
                Replace the icing with a crumble topping for a more coffee
                cake-like variation.
            </p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a
                    13x9-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain juice from the cans of peaches into a measuring cup
                    until you have 1/2 cup of peach juice. Set aside the 1/2 cup
                    of peach juice and discard remaining juice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chop peaches and pat with paper towels to remove some of the
                    excess moisture. Add chopped peaches to a small mixing bowl
                    and toss with 1 tablespoon of the cake mix.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large mixing bowl, beat remaining cake mix, eggs, oil,
                    and 1/2 cup reserved peach juice with an electric mixer
                    until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
                    Sprinkle chopped peaches evenly over batter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into
                    the center comes out clean (a few moist crumbs are okay), 28
                    to 33 minutes. Allow cake to begin cooling on a wire rack
                    while you prepare icing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place brown sugar, butter, and cream in a saucepan and bring
                    to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar
                    is dissolved, 10 to 15 minutes from the time you first
                    turned on the heat. Stir in vanilla until well mixed, then
                    remove from heat.
                </li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in confectioners' sugar until smooth.</li>
                <li>
                    Immediately pour icing over warm cake, and spread quickly
                    with a spatula into an even layer, as icing will set
                    quickly.
                </li>
            </ol>
